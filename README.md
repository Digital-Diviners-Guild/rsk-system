# rsk (alpha)
A FoundryVTT system for playing [RuneScape Kingdoms](https://steamforged.com/pages/runescape-kingdoms#products).

**Note: This system does not provide any content, you will need to populate the item and actor sheets within your foundry world.**

### What the system provides
* sheets to create and manage characters and items
* statuses that can be applied to characters/npc's
* basic inventory tracking
* dice formulas for rolling skill checks with advantage, disadvantage, and applying modifiers.

#### Automation:
In this pre-release state, a lot of game play mechanics will need to be manually tracked.    
Though there are a few things that have automation already.
- applying backgrounds during character creation
- rolling various skill checks
- spending runes when casting spells
- spending prayer/summoning points when praying/summoning
- applying damage (currently just armour soak, no margin bonus or qualities)
- resting

### Roadmap
* Improved UI/UX
* More Automation
    * Combat Action automation
        * range, dots, qualities, margin bonuses, and more
    * Action Macros for things like Identifying or Disarming a trap, Fishing, etc..
    * Death Consequences
* and more...
